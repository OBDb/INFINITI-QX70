generations:
  - name: "First Generation (as INFINITI FX)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The vehicle that would later become the QX70 was originally introduced as the INFINITI FX, pioneering the performance-focused luxury crossover segment with its 'bionic cheetah' design philosophy. Built on Nissan's FM (Front Midship) platform shared with the 350Z sports car and G35 sedan, it featured an aggressive, sports car-inspired design with a long hood, sharply raked windshield, and muscular proportions. Available as the FX35 with a 3.5L V6 producing 280 HP or the FX45 with a 4.5L V8 producing 315 HP, both paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. All models featured all-wheel drive (with rear-wheel drive later available on V6 models), sport-tuned suspension, and a rear-biased weight distribution that delivered handling dynamics more akin to sports sedans than traditional SUVs. The interior combined luxury elements with a driver-focused cockpit, featuring premium materials and advanced technology for its time including an available rear-view camera and intelligent cruise control. This generation established the FX as a distinctive alternative to conventional luxury SUVs, prioritizing on-road performance and bold styling over traditional utility."

  - name: "Second Generation (as INFINITI FX, later QX70)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The second-generation maintained the performance-focused philosophy of its predecessor while refining the design and technology. Initially launched as the FX, it was renamed QX70 in 2014 as part of INFINITI's nomenclature restructuring. The exterior design evolved with even more aggressive styling featuring bulging fenders, a more prominent grille, and curves inspired by natural forms and athletic tension. Powertrain options expanded to include the FX35/QX70 3.7 with a 3.7L V6 producing 325 HP, the FX50/QX70 5.0 with a 5.0L V8 delivering 390 HP, and in some markets, a 3.0L V6 diesel. All engines paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission, with rear-wheel drive standard on V6 models and all-wheel drive optional (standard on V8 models). The interior featured higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and advanced technology including INFINITI's first implementation of Around View Monitor providing a 360-degree view of the vehicle's surroundings. Available safety innovations included Lane Departure Prevention, Intelligent Brake Assist, and Distance Control Assist. A 2012 refresh updated the styling with a revised grille and front fascia, followed by the name change to QX70 in 2014. Despite its age, the QX70 maintained its distinctive character until its discontinuation in 2017, with a unique position as one of the most driver-focused SUVs on the market, sacrificing some practical considerations like rear passenger space and cargo capacity in favor of style and performance."
